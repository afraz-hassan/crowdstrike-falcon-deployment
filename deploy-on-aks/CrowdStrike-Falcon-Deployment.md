# Deploying Falcon Sensor, Falcon KAC (Kubernetes Admission Controller), and Falcon IAR (Image Analyzer at Runtime) on Azure Kubernetes Service
Below is the complete step-by-step tutorial to deploy Crowdstrike Falcon Sensor, Falcon KAC (Kubernetes Admission Controller), and Falcon IAR (Image Analyzer at Runtime) on the Azure Kubernetes Service.

**Note:** This tutorial contains commands for both Windows PowerShell and Linux.

## Pre-Requisites:

* FALCON_CLIENT_ID (e.g. 632e7cb554197afc656add1985808)
* FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET (e.g. 2CPDpjsfafrgSGRou58w7df4131V40A) 
* Base URL (e.g. https://api.eu-1.crowdstrike.com) OR Crowdstrike Tenant Region (e.g. eu-1)

These three pre-requisites can be same for the falcon sensor, KAC, and IAR. But it is recommended that three of these falcon service have their own different client ID and client secret.
